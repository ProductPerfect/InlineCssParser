# Inline Style Parser for Html Files 

<p><span>A Visual Studio Extension that helps to extract inline styles into a seperate css file.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Supporting .html and .cshtml files for now.</p>
<p>Just right click on a html file source code and extract your all inline styles into a seperate css file. See the attached screenshot below.</p>
<p>I am planning to add html beautification feature on following days.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you realize that something is wrong about it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
